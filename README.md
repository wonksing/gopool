# gopool
This is a pool of goroutines. This project was first started to understand Go, especially channels and goroutines.

Gopool is implemented with a buffered channel of Task struct. Task takes your function and the functionsâ€™s parameter to its fields. Then the task is pulled by Workers that execute the typed function in the task.
